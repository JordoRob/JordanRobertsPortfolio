## Thu, Jul 20

### type: email

### note: Adam sent the email

### description: potential issues by deploying the website on a computer

To martin, discuss some potential issues by deploying the website on a computer.
The following is quoted from email:
1. Our software periodically saves backups of the database, which would not be performed during the time the computer is off.
2. What's more concerning is security, as essentially anyone that has access to the computer will have essentially full access to the database, which will contain, as far as I was told, sensitive information (passwords will be hashed of course, but they can basically modify/delete anything, including the accounts, employee & job info, and backups we store). We can limit the permissions on our server, but I don't believe there is anything we can do to stop someone from simply reconfiguring the permissions and restarting the server

### description: Offered another option

Martin offered to run on a virtual machine hosted on Hyper-V server


## Tue, Jul 25

### type: email

### note: Adam replied

### description: Discussed issues if run the system on a virtual machine

Discussed issues if run the system on a virtual machine. The following is quoted from email:
1. Our system does not require many of the services of an operating system, so a full-blown virtual machine would be a waste of server resources compared to a container.

2. Our system would still require being run on docker. Thus, if we do put it on a virtual machine, we would have our server running on a docker container running within that virtual machine, which is almost equivalent to a virtual machine within a virtual machine. This would probably have multiple issues, including extra performance costs, server resources used, and configuration required.

### note: deployment

### description: From 1pm-4:30pm

Successfully deployed on their machines. Created a syn button for new updates from us.
Adam invited them to attend our final presentation on Aug 17, 2023.
Issues:
1:
There are not following the format of the excel they sent (multiple phone number in the same cell for phone number, like up to 8 numbers in the same cell); we solved by editing function so that the third phone numbers and more will be added to the note section for that employee.
2:
There are not following the format of the excel they sent (3 lines of header and 3 lines of footer for employee list), which results in the break of the function -> there are a couple employees are not imported, we solved by manually added by using “add employee” feature.

Last, took a photo of how the TV display their scheduling (see below)

### note: Instruction of how to sync + task list to guide system + sus questionnaire

### description: Adam sent the email

The following is quoted from email:
So, now that we got the scheduler successfully deployed on your machines, we have since then made some updates and added a help page that has some gifs of how to do most of the major actions on the website. It is still a little unfinished, and we are currently working on making the help page easier for you guys to use (amongst other new features and polishing), but I figured that it would be best for you guys to have something to fall back on while you all learn the new system. 

However, I will need one of you to sync the project to get the new changes, which we made fairly easy to do. On the computer running our server, go to the desktop and you will see a "sync project" file that we created (I forget exactly how it's named). All you need to do is run it (i.e. double click) and that's it.

Also, there's one last thing. We have basically a task list of all the features we would like you to try out on the system attached below, as well as a user experience survey linked herefor your feedback once you are done with the task list (the feedback is for including in our final presentation/report). Ideally, I think that everyone that would be using the system should go through the task list and do the survey; mostly because client feedback is really important (and that we can still make changes), but also since the task list sorta acts as a guide for learning the system. 

That's all. I hope you all have a great day trying out the new system! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!

### note: Follow-up from Dillon

### description: Feedback

Minor issues and a couple of adjustments request. The following is quoted from email:
Following up with some feedback.  We populated the board yesterday and have been using it extensively since.  The project has exceeded our expectations and will be an asset to our office.  I did run into minor issues with the batch assign tool, see attached word document.
 
There are a couple of adjustments and adds that we have compiled.  Let us know what you think and if they are doable.  Please reach out if anything needs more discussion or clarification.
 
1.	Inside the Employee card:
- Rename “Phone Number” to “Personal Number”
- Rename “Secondary” to “Horizon Number”
 
2.	Add to the employee level tags drop down list(Journeyman, 4th, 3rd etc)
- Project Manager
- Safety Coordinator
![employee level tags drop down list](0811_employee-level-tags-drop-down-list.png)
3. Add the ability to search for employee names while on the job window.
 
4.	Add the ability to change font type, size, bold.  Some of the smaller text on the tv gets blocky and pixelated with the current font.  We would like to try a Calibri or Ariel font.  
 
5.	On the main job screen, there are employee tiles where the name is longer then the tile size.  When we hover our mouse over the employee tile the name scrolls.  Can we change it so that any names that are longer then the tile allows to constantly scroll, not just on mouse hover?
 
6.	We have found that we want the Inactive and School Lists to be shown on the jobs screen.  What we did was create jobs called “Inactive” and “school” and assign the employees to it, which is working great.  The issue is that we would also like them to be populated in the employees tab, but they cannot be inactive and on a job at the same time. Also with keeping with the theory and function that when an employee goes to school or goes in active they are removed from the job for that duration.
The doc file (about batch assign) can be found in the from client folder.

### type: email

### note: Explain the requests.

### description: Adam explained

The following is quoted from email:
I'm glad you are enjoying the new system!

For the feedback, most of those we should be able to do just fine (we actually just fixed the issues with the batch assign and they will be merged in soon):

1.  Very Easy.

2. Now with this one, unfortunately with the way it's programmed, there's not a super easy option: We can simply add the roles to the end of the list, though this will mean they will show up last when showing the lists of employee cards on jobs and on the employee page (i.e. it'll list the employees with Foremen first, then superintendent, ..., 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Project Manager, Safety Coordinator), which might not be super visually appealing. The other (probably better) option is to essentially shift all the employees' roles over to be Project Manager, Safety Coordinator, Foremen, etc.. (feel free to correct the order here), which will look nicer, though it will require that we do a remote-desktop meeting so we can go into the database to shift all of the current employees' roles over. 

3. This should also be fairly easy.

4. Unfortunately, this one might be really hard to do. The easiest option for us is to remote-desktop in and adjust the font type, size, and bold while you guys inspect it until it looks good.

5. This was surprisingly difficult to do, but Edwin managed to make it work. Though, he found that all the employee names moving were distracting while moving the employees around, so he gave it only to the projector view. This can be changed though, if you would like.

6. This one is a bit harder but should absolutely be doable. Though, depending on how we do this, this one might also need us to do a remote-desktop thing to adjust the database.

I will keep you posted once we have more changes for you to sync in!

### note: Clarification of the explanation from Adam

### description: Dillon replied

The following is quoted from email:
We can setup a remote connection whenever works for you, let me know and I can get you the login information.  We use teamviewer for remote access, you will need to download the client and create an account for remote control.  
 
1.	Great
2.	Having Project Manager and Safety Coordinator at the end of the list is fine.  Having them stand out and not be mixed in with the other employees is almost ideal even.
3.	Great
4.	That is fine, we do not need the option to change font whenever we want.  Set it to something a bit more legible and leave it be.
5.	Auto-scrolling is not a must have, more of a quality of life thing, and also in my mind help reduce any potential burn in on the screen.  If it is something we could demo like the font changes that would be great, if not and we risk having other issues arise because of it then no worries.
6.	Great

The following is quoted from email:
Wonderful! If we can get a teamviewer session set up tomorrow sometime, that would be perfect!

Also, I should probably mention that technically tomorrow is the last day to make changes to the project, though the course does not actually end until Thursday (for our final presentation). 

And there's one last thing that we would just like to clarify. For fixing having inactive and in-school more visible, would you like it so that it is shown on just the projector view? Or were you preferring to have an interactive version on the job page as well? Asking this since just displaying them on the projector view is easy for us to do, though it will require a lot more effort to also add it onto the job page with a way to drag-drop onto them.

### note: Describe how the new changes go

### description: Dillon emailed

The following is quoted from email:
All went great on the TV, sync ran no issues.  All changes were there and tested working.
 
Had issues with all of our client machines not seeing the updates.  The solution we found was to do a full refresh (ctrl+f5) of the website, one machine required 3 refresh cycles to see the changes.
 
I have tested the features and they all look and work great.  The consensus among us left in the office today is the new font is much better.
 
Can confirm the issues with batch assign are corrected.

Ay that's awesome! We're glad to hear that!

If any of you come across any more bugs or things to change tomorrow, feel free to let us know. If they're easy/critical fixes we can make them right away, any bigger changes we'll make note of in our final documentation for future people working on the project.

We're currently just finishing the documentation, and hopefully by tomorrow or Thursday we will email you to have you sync one last time to get the new documentation. 

That's all, hope you have a great day!
